Scheduler Brainstorming - Fetch
Run at 
12:30am - Very beginning of the day 
11:30pm - Very end of the day
Use a global timer variable and just set it each time a go routine executes, then spawn a new go routine

--Go Routine
Get time UDT
Switch time
	case: time is between 12:30am and 11:30pm - 12:30am has just run
		schedule next run for 11:30pm
	case: time is between 11:30pm and 12:30am
		schedule next run for 12:30am - 11:30pm has just run
Block until timer executes
Run Fetch
Spawn new go routine using this function


Scheduler Brainstorming - Purge
Purge runs once a day at 12:00pm? or 1:00am?
